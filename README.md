# Diagnostic_CNN
Program to test different CNN architectures for classification of medical images (in python, tensorflow)

This includes so far a:
- VGG-19 like architecture
- ResNet50 architecture
- Xception architecture

This is not a full program yet as it requires manual adjustments in the source code to change CNN architectures and models. It is more for me to learn and to play around.

The aim of this study is to diagnose different diseases using patient fibroblasts. Due to data protection there are no images included!
