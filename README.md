# Diagnostic_CNN
Program to test different CNN architectures for classification of medical images (in python, tensorflow)

This includes so far a:
- VGG-19 like architecture
- ResNet50 architecture
- Xception architecture

This is not a full program yet as it requires manual adjustments in the source code to change CNN architectures and models. It is more for me to learn and to play around.
